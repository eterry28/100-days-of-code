# Risks

**Description**

Each territory has a certain number of armies which can be used to attack adjacent territories. The player can attack as often as they want, but conquering too many territories stretches out their troops so that the territories can be reclaimed easily. Additional armies are given based on conquered territories, so not expanding fast enough will also lead to losing. A straight forward AI is relatively easy to produce.

Variants: Dice Wars is a high-speed Flash game that is similar to Risk.
