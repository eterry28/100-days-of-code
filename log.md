### Day 1: June 10, 2019 Monday

**Today's Progress**: I started on a bookmarks api.

**Thoughts** 
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So the kickoff on my 100 Days of Code journey didn't go quite as planned. However, I think I am at a place where I can set myself up for success. Am I ready for this? Time will tell. Let's talk about bookmarks.</p>

<p>Like many of you, I have a project list. A wish list of sorts. It seems to be a prerequisite for anyone who has written code as an enthusiast or professional to keep such a list. I really wonder how I came up with such a long list without making a dent in any of it. 100 Days of Code will help me make that dent!</p>

<p>First up - a basic REST API in PHP. I know. I know. PHP gets kicked and pushed around a lot these days. Remember this though - today's web was built on the PHP stack. PERL, Java, and ASP where players too, but rightly or wrongly PHP held court. We're talking the year 2000 here. Yes, I am that old. I digress. I wanted to create a basic REST API using PHP. I had an idea for a bookmark service. Dang you Google and your need to be everywhere!</p>

### Day 3: June 13, 2019 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Made a create function for the bookmarks api.
2. Made a delete function for the bookmarks api.

**Thoughts** 
Continuing to push through. I'll probably add the delete today as well. Then spend some time thinking of auth/tokens.
I managed to get a delete function in.

### Day 4: June 14, 2019 Friday

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Made a read single function for users in the bookmarks api.

**Thoughts** 
Continuing to push through. I really need to spec things out that do not fit the traditional CRUD mold. Auth can be tricky. Oh my...I guess a website or browser plugin would be nice.
