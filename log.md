# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 0: June 06, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 1: June 10, Monday

**Today's Progress**:

<p>So the kickoff on my 100 Days of Code journey didn't go quite as planned. However, I think I am at a place where I can set myself up for success. Am I ready for this? Time will tell. Let's talk about bookmarks.</p>

<p>Like many of you, I have a project list. A wish list of sorts. It seems to be a prerequisite for anyone who has written code as an enthusiast or professional to keep such a list. I really wonder how I came up with such a long list without making a dent in any of it. 100 Days of Code will help me make that dent!</p>

<p>First up - a basic REST API in PHP. I know. I know. PHP gets kicked and pushed around a lot these days. Remember this though - today's web was built on the PHP stack. PERL, Java, and ASP where players too, but rightly or wrongly PHP held court. We're talking the year 2000 here. Yes, I am that old. I digress. I wanted to create a basic REST API using PHP. I had an idea for a bookmark service. Dang you Google and your need to be everywhere!</p>
